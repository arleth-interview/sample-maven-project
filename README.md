# sample jdk 14, maven built app

Welcome!

### Goal

Define a simple password validator in Java. 

Feel free to use any class provided in the standard Java Class Library (JCL) JDK 14. I don't want to focus on syntax or even put too much pressure on getting the app to compile ;) 

The intent of this exercise is to use the project as a way of focusing our time. To create a way for us to discuss various approaches to coding and even write a little code along the way

### the classes provided

#### ./main/java/dtci/PasswordPattern.java 

A simple pojo. This class should not define the implementation of the validator or how password patterns are evaluated on input

#### ./main/java/dtci/PasswordValidator.java

Place to implement password validation

#### ./main/java/dtci/Main.java 

Demonstrate and execute the validator with commandline arguments

#### ./test/java/dtci/PasswordValidatorTest.java 

Document and define all tests for the app here. It is not necessary to implement the tests.     

As time permits, I'd like to have discussion on how to modify to approach, redefine the pattern, PasswordPattern values and min counts.
