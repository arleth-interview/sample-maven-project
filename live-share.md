# how to use live share

Open a new web browser window as incognito/inPrivate (I don't want to mess with your cookies :)

Navigate to

https://github.com/arleth-interview

Sign in with

username: arleth-interview
password: DTCI-interview1

After the interview I'll reset the password :)

Now you can open the private repository -

https://github.com/arleth-interview/sample-maven-project

Read through the README that comes up and while you do that I'll setup the LiveShare Session 

### connecting to the live share session

1) interviewer starts the session
2) shares a link to be pasted into a new tab in the incognito window opened above
3) vs-code will prompt you open or download the tool, click CANCEL, then click on 
    Join the Live Share session from the browser (preview)
4) a prompt (lower right of the window) click "sign in", select "Sign In With GitHub"
5) FINALLY click the green "Authorize VisualStudioLiveShare"
